- Hello, this is a small little project I did while I was doing my Maths Homework.
  I use CASIO's fx-GC50 calculator model to do my statistics homework.

- Although this calculator is incredibly usefull and I love it's capabilities.
  I was never able to understand it's logic behind it's calculations.

- So naturally this peaked my interest. And like the bored nerdy highschool student I was,
  I decided it was a good idea to replicate this calculator's way of doing statistics and
  make my own program to truly understand what it was doing behind the scenes.

- I found this experience very educational especially when I was coding the logic for
  finding lower and upper quartiles.

- The program is not yet finished, but after my IB examinations, I intend to finish it
  and give it the ability to do more advanced calculations.
  I am not such a big statistics fan myself, in fact I'm more into analysis. However
  I take any learning opportunity that I can if I am interested in it.
  And thankfully ever since I was 15, I've been hard-wired to be interested in very scientific
  and mathematical topics

- In the future, I intend on adding a GUI and making it compute graphs.
- I also want to add an option to perform calculations on 2 variable datasets like the fx-CG50 can

- Thank you for reading this, have a wonderfull day!!! üëç
